===ProtoX Controller Firmware, based on the stm32f4xx GCC Barebones Project===

--Build instructions

Make sure you have the arm-none-eabi(gcc, etc...) tools installed: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded

Running make on the top directory should build both the driver library, support files, and main.c
Output files are in the build/ directory

--Programming instructions (using openOCD and gdb)

Connect using openOCD and the included configuration file.
$ openocd -f stm32f4xx-openOCD.cfg

On a separate terminal window, run arm-none-eabi-gdb
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb 

Connect to openOCD
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:3333

Load program the stm32f4xx
(gdb) file build/protox-controller.elf
(gdb) monitor reset halt
(gdb) load
(gdb) monitor reset init

To run you program:
(gdb) continue
